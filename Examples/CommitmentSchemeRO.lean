# Random Oracle Commitment Scheme — Caching Oracle Model

A commitment scheme in the random oracle model: `commit(m, s) = H(m, s)` where
`H : M × S → C` is a random oracle modeled via `cachingOracle`.

Following `docs/commitment_scheme.tex`, we prove three security properties:

1. **Binding** (Lemma cm-binding):
   `Pr[win] ≤ ½ · t² / |C|` where `t` is the query bound.
   The adversary and verification share the **same** random oracle (via `cachingOracle`).

2. **Extractability** (Lemma cm-extractability):
   `Pr[win] ≤ ½ · t² / |C|` with the same structure.
   Extractor searches the commit-phase trace for a matching entry.

3. **Hiding** (Lemma cm-hiding):
   `tvDist(real, sim) ≤ t / |S|` where the simulator outputs a uniform commitment.
   Proof via identical-until-bad: bad = adversary queried `(m, s_challenge)`.

All games use `cachingOracle` so that the adversary and verification/commitment
share the same random oracle, matching the random function model.

These are the commitment scheme algorithms, defined as oracle computations
that query H. When run under `cachingOracle`, all queries share the same
random function. -/

/-! ## 1. Binding

**Textbook (Lemma cm-binding)**: For every `t`-query adversary A^H that outputs
`(c, m₀, s₀, m₁, s₁)`:
  Pr[m₀ ≠ m₁ ∧ Check^H(c, m₀, s₀) = 1 ∧ Check^H(c, m₁, s₁) = 1] ≤ ½ · t² / |C|

The adversary and Check use the **same** random oracle H. We model this by
running the entire game (adversary + verification) inside `simulateQ cachingOracle`. -/

  queryBound : IsPerIndexQueryBound run (fun (_ : M × S) => t)

/-- The binding game in the random oracle model.

The adversary outputs `(c, m₀, s₀, m₁, s₁)`, then Check verifies both openings
using the **same** random oracle. Win condition: `m₀ ≠ m₁` and both checks pass.

The game runs inside `simulateQ cachingOracle` starting from an empty cache,
so all queries (adversary's and verification's) share the same random function. -/

    let c₁ ← query (spec := CMOracle M S C) (m₁, s₁)
    return (decide (m₀ ≠ m₁) && (c₀ == c) && (c₁ == c)))).run ∅

/-- **Binding theorem (Lemma cm-binding)**: The probability that any `t`-query
adversary wins the binding game is at most `½ · t² / |C|`.

The proof in the textbook splits into two cases:
- Case 1 (collision): Both `(m₀,s₀)` and `(m₁,s₁)` were queried by A, so
  the trace contains a collision. By ROM collision resistance, this happens
  with probability ≤ ½ · t(t-1) / |C|.
- Case 2 (unpredictability): At least one pair was not queried by A, so
  A "guessed" the oracle output. By ROM unpredictability, this happens
  with probability ≤ 1/|C|.
Together: ½ · (t²-t+2) / |C| ≤ ½ · t² / |C| for t ≥ 2.

This requires ROM-CR and ROM-unpredictability lemmas not yet in the library. -/

**Textbook (Lemma cm-extractability)**: There exists a deterministic extractor E
such that for every `t`-query two-phase adversary A = (A_commit, A_open):
  Pr[Check^H(c,m,s) = 1 ∧ E(c, trace) ≠ (m,s)] ≤ ½ · t² / |C|

/-! ## 3. Hiding

**Textbook (Lemma cm-hiding)**: There exists a simulator S such that for every
`t`-query adversary A, the following two distributions are `t / |S|`-close:
  Real: A^H(state, H(m, s))  where (m, state) ← A^H, s ← S
  Sim:  A^H(state, S^H)      where (m, state) ← A^H, S^H outputs uniform C

The simulator simply outputs a random element of C.

The proof uses identical-until-bad with a counter-based bad predicate.
The state tracks `(cache, saltCount)` where `saltCount` counts how many
queries with salt `s` have been processed (including the challenge query).
Bad is defined as `saltCount ≥ 2`, meaning at least one ADVERSARY query
had salt `s` in addition to the challenge commitment query.

Since the challenge query always increments `saltCount` by 1, we have:
- `saltCount = 0`: no salt-s queries yet (before challenge, no adversary salt-s)
- `saltCount = 1`: only the challenge query had salt s (no adversary salt-s)
- `saltCount ≥ 2`: at least one adversary query had salt s

When `¬bad` (`saltCount < 2`), both implementations agree on every query,
because the redirect condition in impl₂ requires `saltCount ≥ 2`.

**Note on the `Pr[bad]` bound**: `Pr[bad]` = `Pr[saltCount ≥ 2 at end]`
= `Pr[∃ adversary query with salt = s]` ≤ `t / |S|`. -/

    -- This is independent of the adversary's message.
    let cm ← query (spec := CMOracle M S C) (default, default)
    A.distinguish aux cm)).run' ∅

/-! ### Identical-until-bad infrastructure for hiding

State: `QueryCache (CMOracle M S C) × ℕ` — cache plus a counter of how many
queries with salt `s` have been processed.

Bad: `saltCount ≥ 2` — at least two salt-`s` queries have occurred. Since the
challenge query `(m, s)` always contributes one, bad means at least one
ADVERSARY query also had salt `s`.

**`hidingImpl₁`** (real): standard caching + increments counter on salt `s`.
**`hidingImpl₂`** (intermediate): same as `hidingImpl₁` EXCEPT when
`saltCount ≥ 2` and cache miss with salt `s`, queries at `(default, default)`.

When `¬bad` (`saltCount < 2`): both implementations are literally identical
(the redirect condition `saltCount ≥ 2 && salt = s` is `false`).

/-! ### Step 2b: Distributional equivalence of intermediate and simulator

The intermediate game (`simulateQ hidingImpl₂ hidingOa`) and `hidingSim` differ
in how the challenge commitment is cached:
- Intermediate: caches `(m, s) → cm` (challenge query goes through normally when
  counter < 2)
- Simulator: caches `(default, default) → cm`

When `¬bad` throughout: the adversary never queries any `(_, s)` point, so it
never observes the difference in caching. The commitment `cm` is a fresh uniform
value in both games (cache miss at `(m, s)` in intermediate, cache miss at
`(default, default)` in sim). The output distributions are therefore identical
on `¬bad` paths.

When bad: the games may diverge (redirected queries in impl₂), but the
`by_upto` bound already accounts for this. -/

      (hidingSim A s) = 0 := by
  sorry

/-- Bound `Pr[bad]` by `t / |S|`.

The bad event is: `saltCount ≥ 2` at the end of `hidingOa`. Since the challenge
query contributes exactly 1 to the counter, bad means at least one adversary
query (during `A.choose` or `A.distinguish`) also had salt `s`.

The bound follows from the adversary's query bound and the independence of `s`
from oracle responses. -/
